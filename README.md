The Matlab script JGR.m reads in the synthetic data (from V.mat) and applies elastodynamic full-field MDD (equation 15) to generate the results in the manuscript (Figures 3e and 3k).

For generating synthetic earthquake recordings using fdelmodc: Install the finite-difference code, fdelmodc, developed by Jan Thorbecke. Source codes can be obtained directly from Â https://github.com/JanThorbecke/OpenSource. More information and the fdelmodc-manual can be found on: https://janth.home.xs4all.nl/Software/Software.html. Elastodynamic double-couple responses can be generated with fdelmodc by using the shear-stress source Txz, selected with input parameter: source_type=2. Note that the final output must be multiplied by -1  to convert from sinistral to dextral slip. In order to calculate responses to rotated double-couples one also needs the responses to the Txx and Tzz source-type (source_type 4 and 3, respectively).
